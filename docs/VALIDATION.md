# Validation — 2026.09.28-community-polish

The complete Python suite passed **124 tests**. The final file-cache optimization
was then checked against all **14 new behavior tests**. **54 DOM/interface checks**
passed, including ten new checks for the added controls and status labels.

| Area | Verified behavior |
| --- | --- |
| JSON saves | Fresh startup, retained accounts, cold restart, corrupt-file refusal, failed atomic replacement rollback, two simultaneous store instances retaining every hit. |
| Migration | Previous SQLite accounts/revision/live snapshot/raid imported exactly; old file unchanged; no SQLite created on a fresh install. |
| Recovery codes | Authenticated owner issuance, CSRF rejection, forgery and replaced-code rejection, digest-only storage, original alias/hits/badges/receipt/cooldown retained. |
| Households | Guests cannot approve; admin allowance admits only its slot count; separate 30-second cooldowns; default per-connection fairness retained. |
| Unlimited hits | Repeated eligible hits accepted beyond previous daily counts; rejected-request throttle does not block an eligible hit. Existing week-long gameplay/achievement tests pass. |
| Rally/estimates | Distinct rolling-window players, repeat-player deduplication, window expiry, next-raid reset, cosmetic unlock, no automatic HP/damage changes. |
| Admin edits | Private persistent actor/before/after history, existing avatar/name/HP/damage permissions and stale revision checks. |
| Interface | Identity collapse/edit, safe code recovery, remembered style, rally display, exact large-integer previews, presets without submission, private history clearing on session expiry. |
| Status | Five-second boss polling, 60-second provider polling, distinct source success/change timestamps, dynamic boss victory name, ETag reuse and reconnect behavior. |
| Existing features | Native login, race date publication, provider envelopes, safe failure responses, Code Red Top 100, public masking, uploads and recovery export. |

The original provider configuration, account seed, PNG and ICO are preserved byte
for byte. The badge calculation function is preserved unchanged; #1 was excluded.
No remote checkpoint feature or external SQL service was added; #10 was excluded.

Validation uses synthetic provider responses and disposable local saves. It did
not contact the live Shuffle/Kick accounts or deploy to DigitalOcean. This Linux
workspace ran Python 3.12; Windows/Python 3.14 was not executed natively. An encoding
regression test simulates the earlier Windows text-decoding failure. Browser checks
use rendered templates in jsdom; native Chromium was unavailable, so no new native
visual-rendering claim is made.

The extracted ZIP startup checks and package integrity results are recorded during
packaging. The code is shipped with its tests for repeatable verification.
